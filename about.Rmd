This shinny app developed for the purpose of delivering Coursera Data Science Capstone Course project. The goal of the project is to build a predictive text model combined with a shiny app UI that will predict the next word as the user types a sentence similar to the way most smart phone keyboards are implemented today using the technology of Swiftkey.


Upon initial load up of the application, "NULL" will be displayed at the 'Next word predict' as textbox.
User may then start entering a phrase to begin the next word prediction.
Results
Next word predicted is shown at the 'Next Word May Be:' textbox.
